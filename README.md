# Monitoring with [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org)

## Idea and background
I like and use Graylog for monitoring and evaluation from an IT security perspective. Since the infrastructure to be monitored is rather clear, it made sense to also use Graylog for other parameters such as CPU and hard drives.
Here you will now find the scripts and Graylog configurations I created for free use.
